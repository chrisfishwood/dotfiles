note:  In iTerm2, in Preferences -> Profiles -> Terminal, under "Terminal Emulation" you have "Report Terminal Type:" set to screen-256color.

also will want to set the colorscheme of iterm2 to match the colorscheme being used

know cause it will error on boot).

brew install reattach-to-user-namespace
