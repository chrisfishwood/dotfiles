Vroom is a plugin for running you Ruby tests, specs, and features. It allows you to speed up your development since you don't have to jump around to different windows or tabs.

If you're hacking away on your awesome Ruby app, and you open your spec, you can easily run the whole file by hitting <Leader>r, or nearest test with <Leader>R. This is then remembered, so if you switch back to your code, you can then hit <Leader>r again and that last test will be run.
